# Knowledge Repo (PARA + Daily Notes)

Built on Tiago Forte-style PARA structure with daily capture + prioritization.

## Structure
- `projects/` active outcomes with deadlines
- `areas/` ongoing responsibilities
- `resources/` reference material
- `archive/` inactive/completed material
- `daily/YYYY/MM/` daily notes
- `PRIORITIES.md` rolling priorities (today/this week)

## Rules
1. Capture important events/decisions/tasks in the current daily note.
2. Every task must include a project tag or project path.
3. End-of-day consolidation promotes key items from daily note into projects/areas/resources.
4. Re-index after consolidation.
